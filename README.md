# 🚀 The "I'm Too Cool for Basic Trading" Crypto Dashboard

So, you want to analyze crypto without losing your shirt? Welcome to the dashboard that's smarter than your average TA enthusiast but not quite skynet (yet).

## 🎭 What's This All About?

This isn't your grandfather's trading dashboard. It's a full-stack crypto analysis tool that combines traditional indicators with machine learning, because why use just one brain when you can use two? 

### 🔮 Features (aka "The Fancy Stuff")

- **Real-time Price Tracking**: Because staring at minute candles is totally healthy
- **LSTM Predictions**: AI trying its best to guess where your money's going
- **Bollinger Bands**: For when you need fancy lines to tell you you're FOMO-ing
- **RSI & MACD**: Classic indicators for the traditionalists in the back
- **Anomaly Detection**: Spots market manipulation faster than you can say "whale alert"

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Clone this bad boy:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crypto-dashboard.git
```

2. Install dependencies (because we're needy like that):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run it like it's hot:
```bash
python app.py
```

## 🧠 How It Works

This dashboard is like having a team of analysts in your pocket, minus the expensive suits:

- **Data Collection**: Pulls data from Kraken (yes, we could've used Binance, but we're hipsters)
- **Technical Analysis**: All your favorite indicators, now in one place
- **Machine Learning**: LSTM neural networks trying to predict the future (spoiler: it's trying its best)
- **Anomaly Detection**: Because sometimes the market is more manipulated than your Instagram feed

## 📊 Dashboard Components

1. **Price Chart**: The star of the show, now with extra Bollinger Bands for your viewing pleasure
2. **RSI**: For when you need confirmation that yes, it was indeed overbought
3. **MACD**: The classic "should I or shouldn't I" indicator
4. **ML Predictions**: Our AI's best guess (don't @ us if it's wrong)
5. **Anomaly Detection**: Keeping an eye out for suspicious activity (looking at you, whales)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This isn't financial advice. If you use this dashboard to YOLO your life savings and it goes wrong, that's on you. The AI is trying its best, but it's about as reliable as your ex's promises.
